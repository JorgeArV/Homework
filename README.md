# Stock Data Analysis leveraging VBA

![stock Market](Images/stockmarket.jpg)

In this project, I have leveraged VBA scripting to analyze stock market data. The VBA script loops through all the stocks for one year ant output the following information: 

 * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.
  
  * Conditional formattiong highlights positive changes in green and negative changes in red.
  
  * VBA script returns the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume".
